    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Each creation is a <strong>celebration of imperfection</strong>, a tribute to traditional craftsmanship
      where the hand’s touch is evident in every curve and texture. We believe in <strong>slow design, sustainability</strong>,
      and meaningful connections between objects and their owners.
